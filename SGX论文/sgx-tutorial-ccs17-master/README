Abstract
--------

Abstract: In this tutorial, we will first introduce the basic concepts
of Intel SGX, its development workflows, potential applications and
performance characteristics. Then, we will explain known security
concerns, including cache/branch side-channel attacks and memory
safety issues, and corresponding defenses with various working
demos. Last but not least, we will introduce various ways to quickly
start writing SGX applications, specifically by utilizing library OSes
or thin shielding layers; we will explain the pros and cons of each
approach in terms of security and usability.

Biography

Biography: Taesoo Kim is an Assistant Professor in the School Computer
Science at Georgia Tech. He also serves as the director of the Georgia
Tech Systems Software and Security Center (GTS3). He is interested in
building a system that has underlying principles for why it should be
secure. Those principles include the design of a system, analysis of
its implementation, and clear separation of trusted components. His
thesis work, in particular, focused on detecting and recovering from
attacks on computer systems. He holds a BS from KAIST (2009), a SM
(2011) and a PhD (2014) from MIT in CS.

Zhiqiang Lin is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at The
University of Texas at Dallas. He earned his PhD from Computer Science
Department at Purdue University in 2011. His primary research
interests are systems and software security, with an emphasis on
developing program analysis techniques and applying them to secure
both application programs including mobile apps and the underlying
system software such as Operating Systems and hypervisors. Dr. Lin is
a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and the AFOSR Young Investigator
Award.

Chia-Che Tsai is a PhD candidate at Stony Brook University, and will
soon join the RISE Lab at UC Berkeley as a postdoc researcher. He is
also joining the Computer Science and Engineering department of Texas
A&M University in Fall 2018 as a faculty. He is interested in building
OSes and runtimes with a balance between usability, security, and
performance. He is the main contributor to the Graphene library OS, an
open-source framework for reusing unmodified Linux applications on
Intel SGX and other various host options.
